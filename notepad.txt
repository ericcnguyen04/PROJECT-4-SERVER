work on backend

make sure 'create' controller is working, make a test.js file and create pieces to db
notes: i believe create controllers doest have a get route for form, just a post


make sure 'inventory' controller is done, pretty sure it is, once you have done line 12, go to react and display all db clothes



Notes:

no where clause in CREATE

findOrCreate requires where clause

insertInto does not need where clause
