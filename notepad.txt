sequelize model:create --name user --attributes name:string,email:string,password:string
sequelize model:create --name fit --attributes nickname:string,type:string,status:boolean,favorite:boolean,duration:string,userId:integer


sequelize model:create --name favorite --attributes userId:integer,fitId:integer



work on backend

make sure 'create' controller is working, make a test.js file and create pieces to db
notes: i believe create controllers doest have a get route for form, just a post


make sure 'inventory' controller is done, pretty sure it is, once you have done line 12, go to react and display all db clothes



Notes:

no where clause in CREATE

findOrCreate requires where clause

insertInto does not need where clause


need to do:

render only users logged in

edit on same page

we need to make status all false when created
